# 🐍 Python for Everybody Specialization

Welcome to my **Python for Everybody Specialization** repository! 🎉  
This journey builds upon the success of the **Python for Everybody** course and dives deep into fundamental programming concepts using Python. By the end of this specialization, I'll have mastered **data structures, networked application programming interfaces (APIs), and databases**, culminating in a **Capstone Project** where I'll design and develop my own applications for **data retrieval, processing, and visualization**. 🚀
