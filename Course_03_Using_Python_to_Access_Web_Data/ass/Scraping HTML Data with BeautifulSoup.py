"""
Scraping Numbers from HTML using BeautifulSoup In this assignment you will write a Python program similar to http://www.py4e.com/code3/urllink2.py. The program will use urllib to read the HTML from the data files below, and parse the data, extracting numbers and compute the sum of the numbers in the file.

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you need to process for the assignment.

    Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.html (Sum=2553)
    Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_57125.html (Sum ends with 54)

You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url for analysis.

# To run this, you can install BeautifulSoup
# https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4

# Or download the file
# http://www.py4e.com/code3/bs4.zip
# and unzip it in the same directory as this file


from urllib.request import urlopen
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import ssl

#parameter
content = []
total = 0
# Ignore SSL certificate errors
ctx = ssl.create_default_context()
ctx.check_hostname = False
ctx.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE

url = input('Enter - ')
html = urlopen(url, context=ctx).read()

# html.parser is the HTML parser included in the standard Python 3 library.
# information on other HTML parsers is here:
# http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-a-parser
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")

# Retrieve all of the anchor tags
tags = soup('span')
for tag in tags:
    content.append(tag.contents[0])
    
for i in range(len(content)):
    total = total + int(content[i])
print("Sum:",total)
